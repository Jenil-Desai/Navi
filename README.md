## 🌟 Overview

**Navi** is a smart contract system that enables secure and decentralized token swapping between EVM-compatible chains. It acts as a bridge or relay layer, ensuring tokens are moved efficiently and verified on both ends. Whether you're building DeFi protocols or cross-chain applications, Navi ensures a frictionless experience for token mobility.
